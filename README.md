Fastest Searching Dictonary

This is the fastest searching words project. In this project i am using data structures a topic is their name BINARY TREE this is called as fastest searching inserting and deleting algorithm.
Why this is fastest searching Dictonary?
This is because i have used a head node and 26 alphabet a,b,c..z
as sub node and again in this 26 subnode i have again made 26 subnode as per my requirement this concept goes on.
so when we we will search a word name Roshan then its time complexity will be as pper the no of letters and if 1000 or 5000 words are save then aslo it will take only 6 steps to search word Roshan.
And other then that if we use array or simple linked list without the concept of trees then its searching time complexity will be as per no of words are saved in dictonary.
  

Now For example i have to save ROSHAN.
Then it will goto headnode and checks for R then in r it will goto s then it will goto h then a then n and in N it will save Roshan. with its meaning. so inserting is also the big O(n) where n is the no of letters.

 



I have used LINKED LIST concept for binary tree and and as per requirement it creates the new new nodes so as to saves the memory it creates only the memory where we have to save the word and meaning.

I have use 5 switch cases	1. Adding Words
						2.  See All Words
							1. All Words
							2. Search By Letter
						3. Search a Word
						4. Delete A Word
						5. Exit
All inserting deleting searching have the time complexity O(n).
I have made this Project in DEV C++.
